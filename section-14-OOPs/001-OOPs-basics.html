            get an overview perspective of the thing we're implementing,
            instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our .</h2>

        <h2>2. Encapsulation - Keeping properties and methods private inside the class,
                so they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods
                can be exposed as a public interface (API)</h2>
        <h2>3. Inheritence - Making all properties and methods of a certain class
            to a child class, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes.
             This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-world
             relationships. </h2>
        <h2>4. Polymorphism - A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a
            parent class[it's more complex than that, but enough for our
            purposes]. </h2>
